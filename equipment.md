# Jaiv
   - 7 segment from parts kit we will think about two digits but only implement one for now to show values from realtime database.

# Kanjav
   - STM32 connected with heart pulse sensor module https://www.amazon.ca/Heart-Pulse-Sensor-Module-Arduino/dp/B01CFGOZM0/
     via https://github.com/WorldFamousElectronics/PulseSensorStarterProject/tree/master/PulseSensor_StarterProject_Arduino
   - Uploding to virtual machine.

# Alexandra
   - SDcard - we will try https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SD
     to pull values from realtime database and store them.
   - Raspberry Pi 3B+

# Pushpinder Kaur
   - BME280 - we will try https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/adafruit-bme680-library/
     to provide temperature to realtime database.
